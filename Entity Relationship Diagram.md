| UnitPrice        | Currency              | Price per unit at order time                                        |
| ExtendedPrice    | Currency              | Total price (Quantity multiplied by UnitPrice)                      |

---

### ðŸŸ£ 5. Inventory  
Inventory management ensures that products are available to fulfill customer orders. Each product has an associated StockLevel, which is updated whenever an order is processed. The LastUpdated field keeps track of inventory changes, ensuring real-time stock monitoring. The Location field helps identify where specific products are stored within the warehouse, reducing retrieval time and improving logistics efficiency.

| **Columns Name**      | **Data Type**         | **Description**                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ProductID           | Unique Identifier     | Primary key and foreign key referencing Product(ProductID)     |

| LastUpdated         | Date/Time             | Date and time when the stock level was last updated              |
| Location            | Text                  | Physical location of the inventory (if applicable)               |

---

### ðŸŸ  6. Approval Entity
The Approval table ensures that every order undergoes an approval process as part of Omega Manufacturingâ€™s workflow. This entity tracks all necessary information related to approvals, providing oversight and accountability. The table ensures that orders go through an authorization process before fulfillment. When a new order is placed, it is assigned an ApprovalStatus (Pending by default). An authorized individual (ApproverID) reviews the order and either approves or rejects it. The ApprovalDateTime logs the exact time of approval or rejection, while the Comments field allows for additional notes. This structured approach ensures accountability and compliance with business policies.

| **Columns Name**      | **Data Type**         | **Description**                                                     |

```
Below is a detailed explanation of the **arrows** and the **'1'** and **'N'** notations in the Entity Relationship Diagram:

---

### **Explanation of Arrows**
- **Direction of the Arrows:**  
  Arrows indicate the flow of relationships between tables. For instance, the arrow from **Customer** to **Order** shows that one customer can have multiple orders. Similarly, the arrow from **Order** to **OrderItem** shows that each order can include multiple items.

- **Types of Arrows:**  
  - **Straight Lines:** Represent primary, one-to-many relationships where one entity connects to multiple related entries in another table.  
  - **Broken Lines or Secondary Links:** Often indicate one-to-one or optional relationships between entities (e.g., between **Product** and **Inventory**).

---

### **Explanation of '1' and 'N'**
- **'1':** Represents the "one" side of the relationship:
  - In **Customer â†” Order**, the "1" next to **Customer** means that a single customer can place one or more orders.
  - In **Product â†” Inventory**, the "1" next to **Product** indicates that a product has exactly one inventory record.

- **'N':** Represents the "many" side of the relationship:
  - In **Customer â†” Order**, the "N" next to **Order** indicates that a customer can place multiple (many) orders.
  - In **Order â†” OrderItem**, the "N" next to **OrderItem** shows that an order can contain multiple items.

---

### **Detailed Breakdown of Relationships**
1. **ðŸ”´ Customer â†” ðŸ”µ Order (1:N):**
   - **Meaning:** One customer can place many orders.
   - **Arrow Direction:** From **Customer** to **Order**.
   - **Key Field Connection:** `CustomerID` is the primary key in the **Customer** table and a foreign key in the **Order** table, linking the two.

2. **ðŸ”µ Order â†” ðŸŸ¡ OrderItem (1:N):**
   - **Meaning:** One order can include multiple order items.
   - **Arrow Direction:** From **Order** to **OrderItem**.
   - **Key Field Connection:** `OrderID` is the primary key in the **Order** table and a foreign key in the **OrderItem** table.

3. **ðŸŸ¢ Product â†” ðŸŸ¡ OrderItem (1:N):**
   - **Meaning:** A product can appear in many order items across different orders.
   - **Arrow Direction:** From **Product** to **OrderItem**.
   - **Key Field Connection:** `ProductID` is the primary key in the **Product** table and a foreign key in the **OrderItem** table.

4. **ðŸŸ¢ Product â†” ðŸŸ£ Inventory (1:1):**
   - **Meaning:** Each product has exactly one associated inventory record.
   - **Arrow Direction:** From **Product** to **Inventory** (with a 1:1 relationship represented by "1" on both ends).
   - **Key Field Connection:** `ProductID` acts as both the primary key in the **Product** table and the foreign key in the **Inventory** table.

5. **ðŸ”µ Order â†” ðŸŸ  Approval (1:N):**
   - **Meaning:** Each order requires one or more approvals.
   - **Arrow Direction:** From **Order** to **Approval**.
   - **Key Field Connection:** `OrderID` is the primary key in the **Order** table and a foreign key in the **Approval** table.
