## Introduction 

Omega Manufacturing is currently struggling with outdated processes that rely heavily on emails, spreadsheets, and manual updates. These inefficiencies have led to delays, frequent errors, inventory mismatches, and poor visibility between departments. The result? Slower operations, frustrated teams, and unhappy customers.

The company is now exploring a more modern, connected solution, and that‚Äôs where Microsoft Power Platform comes in..

## Current Pain Points Slowing Down Omega Manufacturing‚Äôs Efficiency

After looking into company's day-to-day operations, a few key challenges stood out:

- Manual Order Processing: Orders come in via email and are manually entered, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Disconnected Systems: Teams use different systems, making it hard to collaborate or access shared information.  
- Inventory Inaccuracy: Manual updates lead to mismatched stock levels and missed restocks.
- Approval Bottlenecks: Order approvals are delayed due to long email threads and unclear processes.
- Lack of Visibility: There‚Äôs no centralized view of key data like sales trends, inventory levels, or customer history.

These issues are draining productivity and hurting customer experience, exactly the kind of business problem I aim to solve.

## My Role and Approach 

This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate how I use Power Platform to solve real-world business challenges. It also shows how I‚Äôd approach pitching a solution like this to a client or decision-maker.

I mapped the companies challenges to specific Power Platform tools:

‚úÖ Power Apps: To build a user-friendly order management app that eliminates email-based tracking.

‚úÖ Dataverse: For a centralized, secure data backbone connecting all departments.

‚úÖ Power BI: To give leadership real-time dashboards and insights.

‚úÖ Power Automate: Automates approvals, inventory alerts, and order status notifications.  

‚úÖ Power Pages: For customer-facing features like order tracking or inquiry submission.

‚úÖ Copilot Studio: To build AI-powered chatbots that provide 24/7 automated customer support, handling FAQs, guiding processes, and escalating complex issues to human agents.

Each tool plays a role in building a more connected, automated, and responsive system, with minimal disruption and scalable results.
