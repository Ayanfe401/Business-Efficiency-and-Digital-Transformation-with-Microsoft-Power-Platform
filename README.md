# Sales Pitch for Microsoft Power Platform in Omega Manufacturing Industry

Omega Manufacturing is currently facing major inefficiencies in handling customer orders and inventory management. The existing process relies heavily on emails, spreadsheets, and manual tracking leading to delays, human errors, inventory mismatches, and lack of visibility across departments.

The team is putting in extra effort just to stay afloat, manually entering orders, updating stock levels, and managing approvals through emails. The company has decided to replace their current system with a more unified, automated system that ensures seamless data flow, real-time insights, and faster operations.

They are thinking of moving to Microsoft Power Platform.

## Current Pain Points Slowing Down Omega Manufacturing‚Äôs Efficiency

After analyzing Omega‚Äôs operations, here are the critical blockers:

- Manual Order Processing: Orders are captured via email and entered manually, increasing errors and delays.  
- Disconnected Systems: Different teams use siloed tools, making collaboration slow and inconsistent.  
- Inventory Discrepancies: Updates are done manually, causing mismatched stock levels.  
- Approval Delays: Order approvals take time due to email chains.  
- Limited Visibility: No centralized dashboards for tracking sales trends, stock levels, or customer behavior.

These issues reduce productivity, increase fulfillment time, and negatively affect customer satisfaction.
