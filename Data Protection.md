## üìå Overview

As Omega Manufacturing continues to digitize core operations through the Power Platform, securing business data is critical. With customer details, order histories, financial summaries, and product inventory now managed within Microsoft Dataverse, robust security governance is necessary.

This section outlines the role-based access configuration and data loss prevention (DLP) strategy to maintain compliance, mitigate risks, and ensure that each team only accesses data relevant to their function.

## üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Security is enforced through environment roles and Dataverse table-level permissions tailored to business functions:

### üë• Sales Team Permissions

| Feature              | Access Level     |

## üö´ Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies

To prevent accidental sharing or misuse of company data through connectors or third-party services:

### üõ°Ô∏è DLP Policy Configuration in Power Platform:

- **Business Data Only Connectors:**
  - Dataverse
  - Office 365 Outlook
  - SharePoint (internal use only)
  - Power BI

- **Blocked Connectors:**
  - Twitter
  - Dropbox
  - Gmail
  - Facebook

> These policies restrict app creators from connecting business-critical data to external platforms that may lack compliance.

### üîÑ Enforced by Environment:
- Separate environments are configured for production, testing, and development.
- Each has its own DLP policy to prevent cross-environment leakage.

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Role-Based Access             | Implemented via Dataverse Security Roles              |
