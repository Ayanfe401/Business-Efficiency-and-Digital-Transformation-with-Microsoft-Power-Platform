## 📌 Overview

The company leverages Microsoft Power Platform to streamline and digitize its critical operational areas including sales, inventory management, and finance. With key business data now stored in Microsoft Dataverse including customer information, inventory levels, and transaction records, it is essential to implement a comprehensive and robust data protection strategy.

This strategy focuses on four main pillars:

1. A well-structured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework that ensures users only interact with data necessary for their role  
2. Comprehensive Dataverse security configurations to manage access at record, field, and table levels  
3. Enforced Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies that minimize the risk of data leakage or external breaches  
4. Industry aligned security best practices that guarantee ongoing compliance and system integrity

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control, commonly referred to as RBAC, is the foundation of secure user access management. In Omega Manufacturing’s Power Platform deployment, users are categorized based on their business functions, such as Sales, Inventory, and Finance. Each role is assigned permissions that align with job responsibilities, ensuring users only access what they need.

This access minimization principle reduces exposure to sensitive data, prevents unauthorized activities, and improves operational focus across departments.

### 👥 Sales Team Permissions

The Sales Team interacts directly with customers and is responsible for generating and managing orders. Their access must support customer engagement while safeguarding sensitive internal data.

#### 📋 Access Summary

| Feature                  | Access Level     |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Create Orders            | ✅ Allowed        |
| View Orders              | ✅ Allowed        |
| Edit Orders              | ✅ Allowed        |
| Customer Data            | ✅ Allowed        |
| Product Catalog          | 🔒 Read-Only      |
| Inventory Records        | 🔒 Not Allowed    |
| Financial Reports        | 🔒 Not Allowed    |

The sales personnel are granted full access to create, view, and update orders as part of their daily customer interaction processes. They can view customer details to personalize service and review product information to guide customer decisions. However, they are restricted from modifying inventory levels or accessing financial data, as these fall outside their operational scope and could expose the company to risk if mishandled.

### 🏪 Inventory Team Permissions

The Inventory Team oversees warehouse operations, including stock tracking, movement logging, and ensuring product availability. Their access centers around accurate inventory management.

#### 📋 Access Summary

| Feature                  | Access Level     |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Manage Stock Levels      | ✅ Allowed        |
| Update Inventory         | ✅ Allowed        |
| Product Catalog          | ✅ Allowed        |
| Orders Data              | 🔒 Read-Only      |
| Customer Info            | 🔒 Not Allowed    |
| Financial Reports        | 🔒 Not Allowed    |

The inventory users have permission to manage stock levels and ensure that inventory records reflect real-time availability. Read-only access to order data allows them to prepare shipments without modifying sales records. They do not require visibility into customer or financial information, which protects against inadvertent disclosure or tampering.

---

### 💰 Finance Team Permissions

The Finance Team handles the company’s financial reporting, budgeting, and revenue tracking. Their responsibilities involve high-level data analysis, requiring access to transactional summaries but not individual operational details.

#### 📋 Access Summary

| Feature                  | Access Level     |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| View Financial Reports   | ✅ Allowed        |
| Access to Orders         | 🔒 Read-Only      |
| Modify Orders            | 🔒 Not Allowed    |
| Customer Information     | 🔒 Not Allowed    |
| Inventory Data           | 🔒 Not Allowed    |

The finance team members can view and analyze financial summaries to generate reports and track performance. They are restricted from editing orders or accessing customer-specific data to preserve data privacy and ensure auditability. This separation of duties enhances financial compliance and reduces the risk of conflict of interest or internal fraud.

## 🧱 Dataverse Security Configuration

Microsoft Dataverse offers a multilayered security model that ensures users only access the data they are entitled to. Omega Manufacturing configures Dataverse to secure its business data using the following mechanisms:

#### 🔧 Security Mechanisms in Use

| Security Layer           | Implementation Detail                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security Roles           | Custom roles are assigned per department with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions aligned to business needs. |
| Field Level Security     | Specific fields like pricing, personal contact info, or approval notes are hidden or locked from unauthorized users.         |
| Record Level Security    | Users only see records they own or those assigned to their team or business unit.                                           |
| Team Based Access        | Organizational teams reflect reporting lines and help scale access control as the company grows.                          |

Each security layer complements the others to create a comprehensive security perimeter. For example, a user may belong to a team that has access to an order table but still may not be able to see sensitive fields unless specifically granted. This approach ensures both vertical (role-based) and horizontal (record-based) control across the platform.

## 🚫 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies

Data Loss Prevention policies help the company to prevent unauthorized data access, misuse, or export. These policies are configured in the Power Platform Admin Center to control how data flows across services, connectors, and environments.

#### 🔒 DLP Policy Design Table

| Policy Area              | Enforcement Details                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Environment Segmentation | Development, Testing, and Production environments are isolated to prevent data bleed. |
| Connector Grouping       | Business only connectors like Outlook, SharePoint, and Dataverse are permitted.     |
| Blocked Connectors       | Public connectors such as Twitter, Gmail, and Dropbox are blocked from use.         |
| Classification Rules     | Sensitive data fields (emails, pricing) are tagged and protected from movement.     |
| Custom Connector Limits  | Custom connectors are disabled by default and must be reviewed before activation.   |

#### 🔄 Environment Segmentation Summary

- **Development**: Designed for innovation and prototyping. Offers flexibility for creators with minimal restrictions.  
- **Testing**: Reflects production configuration while allowing controlled access for quality assurance.  
- **Production**: Operates under strict policies. Only approved connectors are allowed, and all data interactions are logged and audited.

By applying different policies based on environment type, the company will ensures that sensitive data never unintentionally leaves the approved ecosystem. This protects not only customer and financial data but also intellectual property and internal documentation.

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices Summary

| Security Control             | Action Implemented                                                                |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role Based Access            | Configured based on user function using Dataverse roles and Microsoft Entra ID   |
| Table and Field Permissions  | Defined per team to allow CRUD or read-only access as required                   |
| DLP Enforcement              | Set through Power Platform Admin Center with locked down production rules        |
| Data Auditing and Monitoring| Enabled for all sensitive actions across environments                            |
| Least Privilege Enforcement  | Users granted only the access they need for their responsibilities               |

Each control is designed to reinforce others. For example, auditing supports DLP policies by logging actions, while role-based access ensures users cannot bypass security by switching environments. This layered security model provides resilience against insider threats, accidental misuse, and external attacks.
